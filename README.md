Moreover there is an option to access and schedule the next veterinary appointment and track information about it as well. Apart from the mentioned benefits, there is a possibility to load and save user data and to access pet information, preventing data loss.

Secondary objectives of the following platform would be error handling and feedback to users. For instance, the mentioned objective would level up the user experience and guide a user through potential issues and prevent difficulties. Scalability would be one of the interesting objectives, because the benefit of it is actually the main future goal of many programmers and developers and that is code improvement and enhancement. Furthermore, documentation, support and responsiveness would complete the entire code and its needed functionalities.

In conclusion, the Pet Health Tracker strives to provide a reliable companion for pet owners. Available opportunity to continually improve the platform and the code itself offers a delightful experience for both pets and their devoted caregivers.

## Roadmap

In the second section the reader can expect explanations about listed program functionalities and their features. In the third section the flowchart and its description will be presented and explained. After the third section, the fourth section will be presented by the code of the application containing comments and descriptions. A visual representation of the application output in combination with brief explanations will be provided in the last section.

## Program Functionalities

### User Registration: 
This functionality is essential for users and their ability to set up their accounts with a username and password of their choice, which helps in creating a personalized and secure experience within the application.

### Load and Save Users: 
The system effortlessly loads user data from the ‘users.txt’ file during the application startup simultaneously providing continuous experience for users. The behind-the-scenes functionality is far more important for observing and managing user data between application sessions, enhancing the overall reliability of the application itself. Additionally, with high efficiency the system saves user data to the ‘users.txt’ file. Key of this functionality is to prevent data loss and securely store user’s data for future use.

### Add Pet: 
Using the least amount of time and effort users add details about their pets, including names, breeds, vaccination status, etc. Because of that, this functionality is vital for users to keep an individualized health history for each of their pets, enabling effective tracking and management of them.
